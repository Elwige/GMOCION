This repository contains both the calcium imaging data and the codes for modeling it published in the paper “Gain modulation and odor concentration invariance in early olfactory networks” by Emiliano Marachlian, Ramon Huerta and Fernando Locatelli in Plos Computational Biology during 2023. 

For full explanation of the methods please refer to the paper. Feel free to contact us to any question, advice or criticism. We would really appreciate if you contact us in case you will use the data or model in new works. 

The data is organized in a simple way, each file is a different animal. The name of the file say which treatment the animal received (SAL, PTX, CGP and COC). Inside, in the first column is the glomeruli,  in the second the concentration at what the odor was presented, in the third column the treatment and then the deltaF/F for each frame. Recordings were made at a frame rate of 8 Hz and the duration of each experiment is 10 seconds. Odors were presented from the 2th second to the 6th seconds in all experiments.
